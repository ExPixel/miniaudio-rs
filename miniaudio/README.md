Mini Audio Rust Bindings
===

*Note:*
The upstream version is currently broken due to an outdated cbindgen dependency.
This is a workaround until upstream is fixed. A pull request has been made.

Bindings to https://github.com/dr-soft/miniaudio

**
The crate currently lacks documentation, but for the most part the API is very close the the API of the miniaudio C library.
That can be found in the C library's main header file.
**

Building
---
LLVM and clang must be installed in order to generate the bindings.
Installation instructions can be found here: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html

Example Usage

For more examples, check out the [examples](/miniaudio/examples) directory.

```rust
//! Enumerating Devices

use miniaudio::Context;

pub fn main() {
    let context = Context::new(&[], None).expect("failed to create context");

    context
        .with_devices(|playback_devices, capture_devices| {
            println!("Playback Devices:");
            for (idx, device) in playback_devices.iter().enumerate() {
                println!("\t{}: {}", idx, device.name());
            }

            println!("Capture Devices:");
            for (idx, device) in capture_devices.iter().enumerate() {
                println!("\t{}: {}", idx, device.name());
            }
        })
        .expect("failed to get devices");
}
```
